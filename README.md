Refactor VBA code for stocks analysis


BACKGROUND

In this project, I am performing data analysis for green-energy stocks (from the year 2017 and 2018) using Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), in order to analyze their yearly return and total daily volume. The use of VBA is to automate tedious processes, improve the efficiency and uniformity of the analysis output, reduce the chances of accidents and errors and to write a code that can be used for similar future projects. 

PURPOSE

The purpose of this analysis is to help Steve analyze the green-energy stock market for his parents before investing their money. Steve wants to know how DQ stocks performance over the years in comparison to other green-energy stocks. Results will help him determine if DQ stocks are worth investing his parentsâ€™ money.

SUMMARY RESULTS

Yearly return (%): Green-energy stocks in 2017 had a high ratio of positive yearly returns; however, it fallen down in 2018. It was general trends for all green-energy stocks. The DQ stock had almost 200% yearly return in 2017, but in 2018 the stock dropped and finished the year with negative 63%. These results indicate a risky investment for all green-energy stocks. 

ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES:
Advantages of refactoring code: The advantages of refactoring code are to improve code in terms of efficiency (code is taking fewer steps and time to execute), readability (easy to understand), and functionality (easy to degugging).
Disadvantages of refactoring code: The scenario for two situations may not always same. Sometimes, each situation is very unique to others. So, refactoring the code could be challengeing too.

PROS AND CONS OF REFACTORING THE ORIGINAL VBA SCRIPT:
Refactoring VBA script is challenging for biggeners since they have limited knowledge on overall coding. Sometimes, it will not giving them such confident as if they write the whole codes, even after completing it successfully. However, it might be a part of learning curve of actual coding for any situation.
